The name of this file makes it sound as if this file were an image,
but this file is actually a plaintext file.

This is a logical inconsistency,
which is committed purely for the sake of convenience.

More concretely,
it is slightly more convenient for this codebase's `data` folder
to consists of examples that are plaintext files (instead of images).
